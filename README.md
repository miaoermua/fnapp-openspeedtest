SpeedTest by OpenSpeedTest™ - Free & Open-Source HTML5 Network Performance Estimation Tool.
SpeedTest by OpenSpeedTest™ is a Free and Open-Source HTML5 Network Performance Estimation Tool Written in Vanilla Javascript and only uses built-in Web APIs like XMLHttpRequest (XHR), HTML, CSS, JS, & SVG. No Third-Party frameworks or libraries are Required. All we need is a static web server like NGINX. I started this project in 2011 and moved to OpenSpeedTest.com dedicated Project/Domain Name in 2013.
